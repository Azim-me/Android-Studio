    <string name="textview"><b>Computer programming</b> is the process Of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis,
generating algorithms, profiling algorithms accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation Of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as The source code Of a program

Will automate the performance Of a task (Which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, Often for solving a given problem, Proficient programming thus Often requires expertise in several different subjects,
including knowledge Of the application domain. specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer
programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual
writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.
